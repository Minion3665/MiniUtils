#### Create-machine-utils 1.4.8:
Definitely not changing the version number each time to avoid writing new changelog entries
Fixed... maybe?
Change the menu so that you can put keyword arguments when calling it
Keeping the previous changelog below as it's still relevant to such a minor change only a few hours after release:
Large changelist this time, here we go:
Rewrote the menu class (the old one is still available under the same name (but deprecated. It will likely be removed in the next major release), the new one is now available under Menus)
Added a "not" check, which will be True when a check fails.
Next release is likely to be a documentation release- we'll see how well that goes... (it wasn't)

#### Create-machine-utils 1.4:
Large changelist this time, here we go:
Rewrote the menu class (the old one is still available under the same name (but deprecated. It will likely be removed in the next major release), the new one is now available under Menus)
Added a "not" check, which will be True when a check fails.
Next release is likely to be a documentation release- we'll see how well that goes...

#### Create-machine-utils 1.3.11:
And then remember that you actually need to make it check the negative (I'm really good at programming- please)

#### Create-machine-utils 1.3.9b and 1.3.10:
And once again enable recognising more errors

#### Create-machine-utils 1.3.9:
Fix that small bug with recognising more errors

#### Create-machine-utils 1.3.8:
Allow more types of errors to be recognised, that was really annoying for CancelledErrors

#### Create-machine-utils 1.3.7:
Allow ignoring the 'that exception isn't an exception' exception. That was really annoying for CancelledErrors

#### Create-machine-utils 1.3.6:
Re-remove that emoji support as it was broken

#### Create-machine-utils 1.3.5:
Add better emoji support

#### Create-machine-utils 1.3.2:
Fixed the changelog embed '#' bug... sorry 'bout that

#### Create-machine-utils 1.3.1:
Changed the format of the changelog so that it's a little easier for y'all to see what I mean by it

#### Create-machine-utils 1.3:
This version adds exceptions_case_prefix, a way to prefix bots' exceptions so that when you're given a case ID you instantly know were it came from
We also refined the way we log emoji add errors to add better debugging for you
